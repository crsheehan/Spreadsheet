_**Spreadsheet**_  
This is a Blazor spreadsheet application that works somewhat like Microsoft Excel. It allows you to insert, remove, and edit cells, along with  
creating formulas that reference separate cells to do more complex math. To create a formula, type "=" and then the cells you want to reference  
or the numbers you want to use.

**Features**  
- Excel-like functions  
- Loading and Saving spreadsheets  
- Clearing functionality  
- Highlighted referenced cells

  **Installation**
  (_Note: Git and .Net SDK 9.0+ required_)
    
  To install this project, simply clone the repository:  
  - git clone https://github.com/crsheehan/Spreadsheet.git
  - cd Spreadsheet\GUI-2
  - dotnet run  
  
**Improvements**
I intend to add more keyboard functionality, such as tab and enter, to move the selected cell. I also want to add  
a multi-select tool, as well as a graphing function.
